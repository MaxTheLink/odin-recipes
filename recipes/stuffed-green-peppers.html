                If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to
                your grocery list:

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div class="steps">
            <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>
                    Cut peppers in half, place them in a 9x13 inch baking dish, and set aside. In a large skillet over
                    medium heat, saute the ground beef for 5 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups chopped onion, chopped green bell
                    pepper, and garlic. Reduce heat to low, add tomato sauce, and let simmer while preparing the
                    couscous.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prepare couscous according to package directions, but add the remaining onion to the water before
                    adding the couscous. When couscous is done, combine it with the sauce. Fill bell peppers with the
                    mixture. Top each with shredded cheese.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and slightly brown
                    on top.
                </li>
            </ol>
