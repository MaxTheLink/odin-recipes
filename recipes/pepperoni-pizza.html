        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This Homemade Pepperoni Pizza has everything you wantâ€”a great crust, gooey cheese, and tons of pepperoni.
            The secret to great pepperoni flavor? Hide extra under the cheese! Who needs delivery?
        </p>
        <p>
            My kids love pizza, so pepperoni pizza is usually a surefire dinner win. But if I'm being honest, I rarely
            make pizza for my kids. I view pizza as a cheat night for me, and I get delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
            So when I decided to make pizza at home, I knew it needed to be better than your average delivery. It needed
            tons of pepperoni, a nice crust, great flavor, and maybe even a surprise or two to put it over the top.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to
            your grocery list:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade (I like this no-knead version, though note that this
                recipe makes enough dough for 2 pizzas)
            </li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce (see below)</li>
            <li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni</li>
            <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional</li>
            <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans.</li>
            <li>
                Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar,
                salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix
                until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft,
                sticky dough forms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more
                flour as needed. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza
                pans.
            </li>
            <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza
                pans between the top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.
            </li>
        </ol>
